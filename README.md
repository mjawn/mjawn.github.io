# A Portfolio Website

## Or: How I Learned to Stop Working Exclusively on Legacy Codebases and Embrace the Modern Web.

This is the repository for my new portfolio site, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) using [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) components, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is currently a work in progress.
