# mjawn, a portfolio website

## or: How I Learned to Stop Working Exclusively on Legacy Codebases and Embrace the Modern Web.

This is the repository for my new portfolio site. It is currently a work in progress. As a Front-End Web Developer that has always worked in large corporate environments with old codebases, keeping a portfolio and staying up to date with current technologies has been a challenge for two reasons:

-   For the purpose of a portfolio, I don't have access to source code when I leave a position, so the best I can do is point somebody at a website and say "I worked on this part and that part". In the case of internal projects, there's nothing to show at all.
-   Large IT organizations can be, and in my lived experience so far, are always slow to change. Over the course of my 13-year career, I have yet to work for a company that has embraced modern JavaScript frameworks during my time there. Everything has been jQuery. I've been lucky that a few places embraced HTML5 and CSS preprocessors.

So, the purpose of this portfolio website will be to showcase my past work as usual, but also and more importantly, to showcase my own improvement as I learn new things. The way that I intend to do this is to build the website using modern technologies, and create sample components that are representative of the kind I've worked on in the past. Things like a product list or product detail page for retail, or perhaps a stock holdings table for a brokerage. I have decided on a tech stack based on where my interests currently lie and what I think will be marketable skills that will help me stand out:

-   [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/)): Eleventy is an incredible static site generator written in JavaScript, but does not require it (or really anything) to develop with. It's zero-config out of the box and supports the most popular templating languages. For this site I'm using a Web Components-compliant template language the Eleventy team created called [WebC](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/)). I have been in love with Eleventy since I first discovered it, and it looks like they've got another winner on their hands with WebC.

-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)): This one was a tough pill to swallow at first, but I understood the mission and there are a lot of organizations using it, so it made sense to make myself familiar with it. So far, I think I like it, but I am still getting used to it. I think it will make sense to balance Tailwind's utility-first approach with light use of their `@apply` directive. The most challenging part by far was configuring the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) [plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for class organization.

-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/vuejs/)): Of the 3 modern JavaScript frameworks I've played around with, Vue is by far my favorite. I love that it is incrementally adoptable and flexible enough to be used in any type of website architecture. This should make it a no-brainer for large organizations looking to upgrade their legacy codebases. I don't understand why it hasn't caught on yet. I intend to get myself more comfortable using it and will continue singing its praises. For this static website, I will be using it mainly for component interaction. I also think it would be in my best interest to show Vue in different use cases apart from static sites, like a Single Page App, since any prospective employer looking at this probably doesn't use a static website. I have my own opinions but am also pragmatic.

I am also using GitHub Pages for the first time, with automatic deployments. When a pull request is created to merge a branch into `main`, the NPM scripts used to build the site are run, and the static assets are pushed to the `gh-pages` branch, which triggers a deployment to the live site. It was not the most intuitive thing to set up but seems to working smoothly now. The build script can be found in the `.github` directory.
